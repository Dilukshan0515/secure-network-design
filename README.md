# 🔐 Secure Enterprise Network Design

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **secure enterprise network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, following real-world networking and security best practices.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
The network is designed to securely separate departments using VLANs, control traffic with ACLs, isolate public-facing resources in a DMZ, and protect switch ports from unauthorized access.

---

## 🏗️ Network Architecture
- 🖧 VLAN-based departmental segmentation
- 🔀 Inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick)
- 🧱 Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- 🌐 DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
- 🔒 Switch Port Security
- 📡 DHCP-based IP address allocation

---

## 🔐 Security Rules Implemented
- ❌ HR VLAN cannot access Finance VLAN
- ✅ IT VLAN has access to all departments
- 🔒 Only IT VLAN can access the DMZ
- 🚫 DMZ cannot access internal networks
- 🛑 Unauthorized devices are blocked at switch ports
